1. No reports from fellow classmates because no class
2. Ask for donations, decrease functionality without charging, add functionality with a premium, ease of access with a payment.
3. Tiny scanner app on google play store, only allows 2 documents to be scanned and saved, but with premium you can save more, but all the functionality is there.
Limited sharing options, but with premium there are additional sharing options.
4. Haven't had class last week so no discussion about my app ideas.
